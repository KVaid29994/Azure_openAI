# Text-to-Text Tasks with Azure OpenAI

## Introduction to Azure OpenAI Services
Azure OpenAI provides seamless access to state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), enabling businesses to integrate powerful AI-driven solutions into their applications. With enterprise-grade security, scalability, and compliance, Azure OpenAI services make it easy to deploy AI-powered text processing tasks efficiently.

## Objectives
This project focuses on:
1. **Prompt Engineering for Text-to-Text Tasks**: Demonstrating best practices in designing and optimizing prompts to achieve high-quality model responses.
2. **Evaluation of LLMs for Text-to-Text Tasks**: Assessing model performance using established evaluation metrics such as **ROUGE score** and **BERTScore** to ensure accurate and meaningful text generation.

## Key Features
- Utilize **Azure OpenAI** for advanced text-to-text generation tasks.
- Apply **prompt engineering** techniques to improve response quality.
- Evaluate model outputs using **quantitative NLP metrics**.
- Explore **real-world applications**, including text summarization, paraphrasing, and translation.

## Installation & Setup
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai azure-ai-textanalytics
```
Set up Azure OpenAI credentials by configuring your API key:
```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "your_azure_openai_key"
```

## Model Evaluation
We assess the modelâ€™s text generation quality using:
- **ROUGE Score**: Measures content overlap between generated and reference texts.
- **BERTScore**: Evaluates semantic similarity using transformer embeddings.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Azure OpenAI, this project enhances text-to-text AI applications with optimized prompts and rigorous evaluation techniques, ensuring high-quality AI-driven text generation.
